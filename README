== KAOS

Basically I am sick of my current planning system.

So the below is a list of the things that I initially think a planning system should contain. I want:

* to add a stories.

* to add sub-stories within the story

* to add  sub-storis within the sub-stories and so forth

* to be able to assign users to tasks

* to be able to modify my user history

* to be able to assign more than one user to a story

* to be able to assign a user to multiple stories simultaneously

* to assign a percentage of user attention to a story

* to assign skills to a user, this should help to estimate time based on the tasks points.

* the back-end full implemented using a json API

* the front-end to use some code JS coding

* to intergrate with github in a nice and easy way..
